# Initial Meeting with Gemini (Project Planning):
After a detailed conversation with Gemini 2.5 Pro about the MVP, Learning Schedule, and App Development Phases document, we clarified that Gemini understood the project, and what was needed to complete it. We came up together with a Ear Fatigue Tool specific development phases document that we would follow and check-off as we go along.

# Visual Mock-up:
I also provided Gemini with a visual mock-up of what the MVP app would look like, and verified Gemini understood the mock-up as in reference to the previous documents we discussed.

# Current File and Folder Structure:
To start the coding process, I provided Gemini the current files/folder structure that has already been created and current. I provided the starting code that Projucer provides to help start projects within JUCE.

# Loading it as a Plugin:
One question was about how to test the 'empty' app within a DAW to verify it was working. Although it may not be so important in this initial stage, I would like to see the process of getting a working plugin after building it within the IDE. This would give me a greater oversight and understanding of how to quickly get the app into the DAW for testing later on. I asked Gemini to give me the steps to loading the plugin into a DAW on macOS.

# Issue - Incorrect initial Projucer Project setup:
From the current file and code I gave Gemini, it looks I have set up the project with the wrong starting files, creating a GUI project, instead of an Audio Plugin, and so the template files are not Audio Plugin ready files. I worked with Gemini to fix this issue.
