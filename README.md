![Logo of the project]()# Name of the project:> ear-fatigue-tool# Idea Concept:An audio visualization app that help producers maintain appropriate audio levels in their mixing as they go along, and enourage them to adjust their playback device volume levels accordingly# MVP:A simple resizable floating window that changes colour, based on actual dynamics of master audio channel- Red for dynamics being altered too much- Amber for warning of dynamic compression- Green for 'healthy' dynamics within# 3 Core features:1. Dynamic range visualization with traffic light colors2. Algorithm for detecting dynamics vs perceived dynamics of audio signal3. Warning indicator of moving from loud to 'perceptively loud', e.g. when too much reduction in transients is occurring.# Pain-points:1. Mixes always sound flat and overly compressed by the time I complete the production phase. How do I keep my ear's fresh, and how do I know if I'm squashing too much the dynamic elements of my music just because i've lost objectivity, due to ear fatigue.2. Mixing and mastering at the end of creating my music, I am almost uninterested in it by then, and I've lost interest in what I originally created, so I need to incorporate mixing and mastering into the creative process. However, it is difficult to know if i'm listening to actual loudness (large dynamic range), verse 'perceived loudness' (reduced dynamic range). There are sweet spots for most audio and music mediums, but how do I keep a sense of where the sweet spot is, while composing and producing music? 3. How do I set my optimal listening volume, especially with headphones, based on my mood, tiredness, etc. Sometimes I want to listen loud and get into the music, but that's when I usually loose the most objectivity in dynamics and end up giving myself a huge amount of work at the end to do.4. The "Loudness wars" is pushing for 'perceived loudness' over actual dynamic range, which I think is where music is more enjoyable and lively. I would just like to know where the sweet spot for listening and enjoying music is, where I can be sure my music is actually dynamic and creates impact, rather than guessing how dynamic my music is.# Personal Observations:Listen to Peter Gabriels - Sledgehammer (2012 Remaster). At the start, a panflute or panpipe instrument plays at a certain volume. I noticed that adjusting my listening levels at this point, made the rest of the track sounds absolutely amazing, full of life and impact. It's as if the producers put this sound at this level to calibrate the listener's ear to the sound level they wanted the music to be played at.  I.e. It's meant to be loud and brash, like listening in the front row to performers play at a popular New Orleans music jazz cafe.# Product Goals: What does it achieve?Simplify mixing/mastering for producers with limited experienceMaintain dynamic range while staying within industry standardsReduce ear fatigue through better monitoringKeep producers in creative flow while ensuring technical quality## Installing / Getting startedStill in progress### Initial ConfigurationStill in Progress## DevelopingHere's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developingthe project further:```shellgit clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.gitcd awesome-project/packagemanager install```And state what happens step-by-step.### BuildingIf your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build theproject after some code changes, state them here:```shell./configuremakemake install```Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above getsexecuted.### Deploying / PublishingIn case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to aserver, this is the right time to state it.```shellpackagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password```And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.## FeaturesList three core features, no more, no less:1. Dynamic range visualization with traffic light colors2. Frequency spectrum analysis with color indicators for different bands3. Selection of industry standard dynamic range presets## ConfigurationHere you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter whenusing the project.#### Argument 1Type: `String`  Default: `'default value'`State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can providean example below.Example:```bashawesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"```#### Argument 2Type: `Number|Boolean`  Default: 100Copy-paste as many of these as you need.## ContributingWhen you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is thatanyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they areneeded. You should state something like:"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a featurebranch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code styleguide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take intoconsideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.## LinksEven though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readableformat like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most usefullinks to humans using your project.
