# Name of the project:
> ear-fatigue-tool

# Idea Concept:
An audio visualisation app that helps producers maintain appropriate audio levels in their mixing 
as they go along to protect dynamics, and encourage them to adjust their playback device volume 
level accordingly instead of entering 'perceived loudness' at the mixing stage.

# MVP:
A simple resizable floating window that changes colour, based on actual dynamics of master audio channel
- Red for dynamics being altered too much
- Amber for warning of dynamic compression
- Green for 'healthy' dynamics within

# 3 Core features:
1. Dynamic range visualization with traffic light colors
2. Algorithm for detecting dynamics vs perceived dynamics of audio signal
3. Warning indicator of moving from loud to 'perceptively loud', e.g. when too much reduction in transients is occurring.

# Pain-points:
1. Mixes always sound flat and overly compressed by the time I complete the production phase. 
How do I keep my ear's fresh, and how do I know if I'm squashing too much the dynamic elements 
of my music just because i've lost objectivity, due to ear fatigue.

2. Mixing and mastering at the end of creating my music, I am almost uninterested in it by then, 
and I've lost interest in what I originally created, so I need to incorporate mixing and mastering 
into the creative process. However, it is difficult to know if i'm listening to actual loudness 
(large dynamic range), verse 'perceived loudness' (reduced dynamic range). 
There are sweet spots for most audio and music mediums, but how do I keep a sense of where the sweet spot is, 
while composing and producing music? 

3. How do I set my optimal listening volume, especially with headphones, based on my mood, 
tiredness, etc. Sometimes I want to listen loud and get into the music, but that's when I usually 
loose the most objectivity in dynamics and end up giving myself a huge amount of work at the end to do.

4. The "Loudness wars" is pushing for 'perceived loudness' over actual dynamic range, which I 
think is where music is more enjoyable and lively. I would just like to know where the sweet spot 
for listening and enjoying music is, where I can be sure my music is actually dynamic and creates impact, 
rather than guessing how dynamic my music is.

# Personal Observations:
Listen to Peter Gabriels - Sledgehammer (2012 Remaster). At the start, a panflute or panpipe instrument 
plays at a certain volume. I noticed that adjusting my listening levels at this point, made the rest of 
the track sounds absolutely amazing, full of life and impact. It's as if the producers put this sound at 
this level to calibrate the listener's ear to the sound level they wanted the music to be played at.  
I.e. It's meant to be loud and brash, like listening in the front row to performers play at a popular 
New Orleans music jazz cafe.

# Product Goals: What does it achieve?
Simplify mixing/mastering for producers with limited experience
Maintain dynamic range while staying within industry standards
Reduce ear fatigue through better monitoring
Keep producers in creative flow while ensuring technical quality



## Installing / Getting started

Still in progress

### Initial Configuration

Still in Progress

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:



Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.



And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Features

List three core features, no more, no less:
1. Dynamic range visualization with traffic light colors
2. Frequency spectrum analysis with color indicators for different bands
3. Selection of industry standard dynamic range presets

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.


State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.


## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: 
- Repository: https://github.com/danielastley/ear-fatigue-tool
- Issue tracker: 
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    danielastley@icloud.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
