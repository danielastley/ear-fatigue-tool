# What is juce::AudioProcessorValueTreeState?

juce::AudioProcessorValueTreeState (often abbreviated as APVTS) is a JUCE class designed to manage the state of an audio processor, particularly its parameters, in a structured and efficient way. It acts as a bridge between your plug-in's parameters, the host (DAW), and the plugin's user interface.

At its core, APVTS encapsulates a ValueTree-a hierarchical data structure that stores and manages the state of the audio processor, including all parameters and any additional custom state information you want to persist.
